<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>In December 2023 I joined the Developer Experience team at SignalWire.</p>
<p>In this role, I am working closely with Product, Engineering, Support, Success, and other teams to develop the following types of API documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Guides</li>
<li>Developer Guides</li>
<li>Reference Manuals</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>My work on this team will involve validating, testing, and reviewing APIs and SDKs to build and maintain highly usable and accurate docs.
I will also facilitate documentation reviews, gather feedback, and incorporate changes.</p>
<p>In addition to several other high-priority projects, I am excited to continue efforts to develop and standardize processes and style guides across SignalWire&rsquo;s documentation, and advocate for customers and users.</p>
<p>As a Technical Writer at The Bid Lab in 2022 and 2023, I worked in multiple cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality user documentation, technical proposals, learning content, instruction manuals, and style guides.
I interviewed subject matter experts, built process documentation, wrote technical responses, and tracked deliverables, communicating information gaps between globally distributed, internal-external, cross-disciplinary, and cross-functional teams.
I also maintained a single source of truth to coordinate overlapping project lifecycles.</p>
<p>I have five years of experience in technical communications across various domains, including IT, web, product, and political communication.
I co-founded The People&rsquo;s Canvass Cooperative, a cutting-edge political comms consultancy.
I have also contributed to audiovisual art installations, live hardware audio processing, boutique integrated GIS mapping tools, and several indie games, as a writer, interaction designer, and sound designer.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in English Language and Literature from Carleton College.</p>
