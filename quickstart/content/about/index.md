# About

In December 2023 I joined the Developer Experience team at SignalWire.

In this role, I am working closely with Product, Engineering, Support, Success, and other teams to develop the following types of API documentation:

- User Guides
- Developer Guides
- Reference Manuals
- Tutorials
- And more!

My work on this team will involve validating, testing, and reviewing APIs and SDKs to build and maintain highly usable and accurate docs. 
I will also facilitate documentation reviews, gather feedback, and incorporate changes.

In addition to several other high-priority projects, I am excited to continue efforts to develop and standardize processes and style guides across SignalWire's documentation, and advocate for customers and users.

As a Technical Writer at The Bid Lab in 2022 and 2023, I worked in multiple cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality user documentation, technical proposals, learning content, instruction manuals, and style guides. 
I interviewed subject matter experts, built process documentation, wrote technical responses, and tracked deliverables, communicating information gaps between globally distributed, internal-external, cross-disciplinary, and cross-functional teams. 
I also maintained a single source of truth to coordinate overlapping project lifecycles.

I have five years of experience in technical communications across various domains, including IT, web, product, and political communication. 
I co-founded The People's Canvass Cooperative, a cutting-edge political comms consultancy. 
I have also contributed to audiovisual art installations, live hardware audio processing, boutique integrated GIS mapping tools, and several indie games, as a writer, interaction designer, and sound designer. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature from Carleton College.
